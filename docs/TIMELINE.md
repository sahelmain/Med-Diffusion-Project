## Critical Success Factors

1. **Daily Communication**: 15-min daily standups
2. **Parallel Development**: Work simultaneously, not sequentially
3. **Early Integration**: Test integration frequently
4. **Simple First**: Get basic version working before adding complexity
5. **Backup Plans**: Have simpler alternatives if complex methods fail
6. **Time Boxing**: Strict time limits for each task
7. **Code Reviews**: Quick 24-hour review cycles
