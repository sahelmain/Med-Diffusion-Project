# Detailed Timeline - 4-Week Summer Course

## CRITICAL: This is an intensive 4-week timeline

### Week 1: Foundation & Core Implementation (Days 1-7)
**Day 1**: Project kickoff, environment setup, paper study
**Day 2**: Architecture planning, begin coding
**Day 3**: Parallel development (models, data, DHI)
**Day 4**: First integration attempt
**Day 5**: Testing and debugging
**Days 6-7**: Buffer time, prepare for Week 2

### Week 2: Complete Implementation & Midterm (Days 8-14)
**Day 8**: Focus on reproduction
**Day 9**: Run first experiments
**Day 10**: Generate results for midterm
**Day 11**: Intensive report writing
**Day 12**: MIDTERM SUBMISSION
**Days 13-14**: Brief break, prepare for final sprint

### Week 3: Novel Methods & Experiments (Days 15-21)
**Days 15-17**: Implement novel improvements
**Days 18-19**: Comprehensive experiments
**Days 20-21**: Results collection and analysis

### Week 4: Final Analysis & Submission (Days 22-28)
**Days 22-24**: Deep analysis and report writing
**Days 25-26**: Final report polish and presentation prep
**Day 27**: FINAL SUBMISSION
**Day 28**: PRESENTATION DAY

## Success Requirements:
- Daily 15-min standups
- Parallel development (not sequential)
- Simple implementation first, then complexity
- Backup plans for every major component
